# Streamlit Recipe Generator

## Overview

This is a Streamlit web application that allows users to generate recipes based on a set of ingredients. It will provide step by step instructions on how to cook the recipe using Gemini's native text and image generation capabilities.


# High-level architecture

Streamlit app with the following tabs:

- Recipe Generator
- Recipe Collection
- Ingredients & Preferences
- Settings

Sidebar will have buttons for each of the pages. On the bottom of the sidebar, there will be an input to enter your own Gemini API key.

## Recipe Generator Page

- Text input area for the user to enter a text prompt to generate a recipe. 
- Button to submit the prompt and generate a recipe.
- Clear button to clear the input and start fresh.
- Regenerate button to regenerate the recipe.
- Button to save the recipe to the recipe collection (local storage)
- Recipe output will be a step by step text instructions and images.

## Recipe Collection Page

- Display all the recipes saved in the local storage.
- Each recipe card will have a button to delete the recipe from the local storage.
- Each recipe card will have a button to view the recipe details (input prompt and output recipe)

## Ingredients & Preferences Page

- Top area of the page will be for ingredients.
- Text input area for the user to enter a single ingredient.
- Button to add the ingredient to the list of ingredients.
- List of added ngredients will be displayed in a card.
- Button next to each ingredient to remove it from the list.
- Button to clear the list of ingredients.

- Bottom area of the page will be for preferences. This will be a simple text input area for the user to enter their preferences in free form text which we'll inject into the recipe generation prompt.

## Settings Page

- User can pick imperial or metric units (this will be injected into the recipe generation prompt)

## Low-level architecture

- Streamlit app should live in app.py
- Use Streamlit components for the UI
- Use Gemini API for the recipe generation
- Use local storage to save the recipes
- A services file/layer for all the functions that call the Gemini API
- Prompts folder for all the system prompts used in the app
- Uses new Gemini Developer API/Python SDK
- Use structured outputs from Gemini API with Pydantic to get the recipe in a structured format
- Make sure of Gemini's ability to output text and inline images (interleaving text and images in the output)

## Documentation

- Create a README.md file for the project explaining the purpose of the project, the architecture and structure of the project, and how to run the project.

## Gemini API Example (From AI Studio)

```python

import mimetypes
from google import genai
from google.genai import types


def save_binary_file(file_name, data):
    f = open(file_name, "wb")
    f.write(data)
    f.close()


def generate():
